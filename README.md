## Contact-Managing-App

This project is created by React
Allows you to add and delete contacts based on the API
I applied what I learned and I set up this small project, I used most of the things known in the React and also used the library React-router-dom to facilitate the movement between the pages

### Project Setup
1. Clone the Project - `https://github.com/TejaSankuru/Contact-Managing-App.git`
2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd reactnd-contacts-app-starter-files-added`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
4. Start the app - `npm start`
5. you need also to run this contacts server from here [reactnd-contacts-server.](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server).
